Hello world

Yes, in the first time of learning any programming language, firstly we create a small app. And most of the time it is some words or pictures.
Generally, the most of the people print **"Hello World!"** as an output. Often, we create some apps and use "Hello World!" output for testing purposes of web, mobile or desktop apps. So, we are used to do so. But we can print any other things, too ðŸ˜€.

Let's today we'll print **Hello World!** in Javascript.
There are many ways of printing output in Javascript. For instance, alerts, document.write, innerText, innerHTML and etc...
But today we use the most common Javascript output printing way, which is **console.log**. So, we can print it like below:

```js
console.log('Hello World!')
```

And it is done. We did it.
